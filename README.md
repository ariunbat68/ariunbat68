👋 Hi, I'm Ariunbat!

🎬 I have a deep passion for watching movies, exploring the streets on long walks, and diving into data analysis projects.

💻 Currently, I'm on a journey to master databases and advanced data analysis techniques. I believe that data holds the key to unlocking insights and solving real-world problems.

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not busy with databases and analysis, you can find me at the gym, staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

💞️ I'm always excited to collaborate on data-driven projects, discuss film recommendations, or simply chat about our shared interests. Feel free to reach out!

📫 You can contact me via [linkedin.com/in/ariunbat-dulamsuren-914155237]. Let's connect and explore the fascinating worlds of data and cinema together!
